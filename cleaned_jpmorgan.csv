"### Instruction:
What is the role of prefunding in the context of tranches of subordinated notes?

### Response:
","Prefunding occurs if a tranche of subordinated notes cannot be paid on its scheduled principal payment date due to subordination provisions.

The process is explained in the prospectus under 'Deposit and Application of Funds in the Issuing Entity—Targeted Deposits of Available Principal Collections to the Principal Funding Account—Prefunding of the Principal Funding Account of Senior Notes.'"
"### Instruction:
When can a tranche of subordinated notes be paid on its scheduled principal payment date?
